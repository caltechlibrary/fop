Icon sources for Pokapi
======================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/term/okapi-face/1546683/) of the face of an okapi, used as the icon for this project, was created by [Icons Producer](https://thenounproject.com/iconsproducer/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license. I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS to change the icon color to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.
