Pokapi (_Python Okapi Interface_)  is a Python package for getting basic data from a [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org) LSP server using the [Okapi API](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md).

## Introduction

The [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org) platform is a [library services platform](https://www.niso.org/sites/default/files/stories/2017-09/FE_Grant_Future_Library_Systems_%20isqv24no4.pdf).  The Caltech Library uses a hosted solution by [EBSCO](https://www.ebsco.com) for its [library catalog](https://www.library.caltech.edu/libsearch).   To make writing interfaces and automation scripts in Python easier, the Caltech Library [Digital Library Development team](https://www.library.caltech.edu/staff?&field_directory_department%5B0%5D=754) are developing Pokapi (_Python Okapi Interface_), a Python package that provides an object-oriented interface to accessing in a FOLIO record data via the [Okapi API](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md).


## Installation

The instructions below assume you have a Python interpreter installed on your computer; if that's not the case, please first [install Python version 3](INSTALL-Python3.md) and familiarize yourself with running Python programs on your system.

On **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** operating systems, you should be able to install `pokapi` with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).  To install `pokapi` from the [Python package repository (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), run the following command:
```sh
python3 -m pip install pokapi
```

As an alternative to getting it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org), you can use `pip` to install `pokapi` directly from GitHub, like this:
```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/caltechlibrary/pokapi.git
```
 

## Usage

Pokapi currently provides a basic interface to retrieve records using identifiers that can be FOLIO instance identifiers, item barcodes, or EDS accession numbers. To use Pokapi, first create a `Folio` object with parameters that provide the Okapi URL for your instance, an Okapi API token, and a tenant id.  Assuming that the values are stored in separate variables named `the_okapi_url`, `the_okapi_token`, and `the_tenant_id`, the following code will create a `Folio` object:
```python
from pokapi import Folio, FolioRecord

folio = Folio(okapi_url = the_okapi_url,
              okapi_token = the_okapi_token,
              tenant_id = the_tenant_id)
```

The `Folio` class has only one method on it currently: `record(...)`. This method contacts the FOLIO server to obtain data and returns a `FolioRecord` object with the data stored in fields. The following fields are implemented at this time:

| Field           | Type   | Meaning |
|-----------------|--------|---------|
| `id`            | string | FOLIO instance record identifier |
| `details_page`  | string | URL for _Detailed Record_ page in EDS |
| `title`         | string | Title of the work |
| `author`        | string | Author; multiple authors are separated by "and" |
| `publisher`     | string | Publisher |
| `year`          | string | Year of publication |
| `isbn_issn`     | string | ISBN or ISSN |
| `thumbnail_url` | string | URL for a cover image |

The method `Folio.record(...)` can take any one of the following mutually-exclusive keyword arguments to identify the record to be retrieved:

* `barcode`: retrieve the record corresponding to the given item barcode
* `instance_id`: retrieve the record having the given FOLIO instance identifier
* `accession_number`: retrieve the record corresponding to the accession number in EDS

Here is an example of using the method:

```python
r = folio.record(barcode = "35047019531631")
assert r.id == "1fedf5f3-b631-4d34-8d40-e022f70ab232"
assert r.title == "The bad doctor"
assert r.year == "2015"
assert r.author == "Williams, Ian"
assert r.isbn_issn == "9780271067544"
assert r.publisher == "The Pennsylvania State University Press"
```


## Known issues and limitations

The following are known limitations at this time:

* If a record has multiple publishers, only the first publisher name is retrieved.
* Thumbnail images are obtained by searching non-EDS sources, and consequently, the image retrieved may not be the same as what EDS shows for the record.
